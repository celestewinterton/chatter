### Splash Page
Landing page for when users first arrive at Chatter. Users can sign in, sign up, or explore the site through a demo user without signing up. Check out the live site <a href="https://chatter-with-us.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">here</a>!

If the user clicks on a channel in which they are not a member, they can easily join and start sending messages.

### Create/Edit Channel Form
If the user creates a channel, they will also be able to edit, delete, or leave that channel. If a user did not create the channel, they will not have access to this form. 
![Channel Form](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/96894806/171971158-6b94074f-7c80-4586-9dfc-63a410d9da19.png)

### Live Chat and User Active Status
Channels and direct messages both have an integrated live chat feature that uses socket.io. This allows users to interact in real-time and also shows when users are active by clicking on a user image.

### Direct Message and Multi-Person Messages
Users can create direct messages to another user or a group of users. When they start typing, a dropdown will allow the user to select other users or will autofill when a name matches an existing user. When this field is submitted, a new message will be created and redered in theside navitation menu.

### Search
Users can search for message groups that they are a part of, or all channels regardless of whether they are a member or not. Clicking search results will redirect the user to the targeted message or channel.
